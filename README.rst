Tiny toolbox for time series segmentation.

The toolbox presumes a (univariate or multivariate) time series. For example, consider the following univariate time series:

.. image:: https://github.com/RaoulHeese/pytseg/blob/main/docs/source/_static/plot1.png 

Such a time series can then be segmented into distinguishable segments using the toolbox:

All segments are marked in different colors in the plot. And, finally, these segments can be assigned labels like stationarity:

Green lines indicate stationary segments of the time series.
